    "Formula 1 is a technologically advanced motorsport in which race performance is shaped not only by final results, but also by underlying factors such as tyre behavior, car setup, and track characteristics. Modern Formula 1 cars operate at the intersection of mechanical engineering, aerodynamics, and data-driven decision making. Over recent decades, advancements in engineering and data collection have made it possible to analyze race performance at a much finer granularity, including lap-by-lap pace and stint-level trends. Prior work has shown that these factors play a critical role in shaping race dynamics, particularly through tyre degradation and consistency of lap times over a race distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering-focused analyses of Formula 1 emphasize how regulatory stability and technical innovation influence performance trends over time. For example, a historical review of Formula 1 engineering development highlights how improvements in materials, aerodynamics, and power units have steadily increased both performance and data availability in the sport (Evolution of Formula One Motorsport, Academia.edu). This work demonstrates that as engineering systems become more sophisticated, performance differences increasingly emerge through operational factors such as tyre management and race strategy rather than raw speed alone. This context motivates a closer examination of lap-level performance metrics, which can reveal meaningful patterns beyond race outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "More focused prior work has examined tyre compounds and degradation directly. The official Formula 1 tyre guide explains how different compounds are designed to trade off grip and durability, with softer tyres providing higher initial performance at the cost of faster degradation (Formula1.com, Beginner's Guide to F1 Tyres). Complementing this practical perspective, recent academic research has modeled tyre degradation using lap-time data, demonstrating that degradation can be quantified as a systematic increase in lap times over a stint rather than random noise (arXiv:2512.00640). These studies show that tyre degradation and lap-time variability are measurable, interpretable phenomena. However, much of this work focuses on individual races or modeling approaches, rather than descriptive, multi-season analysis. Our project builds on these insights by examining lap-time degradation and driver consistency across multiple seasons (2021-2025), tyre compounds, and track types using publicly available race data.\n",

    "We hypothesize that softer tyre compounds will show faster lap-time degradation than harder compounds across all tracks. We also expect street circuits to exhibit greater lap-time degradation and higher lap-to-lap variability compared to permanent circuits due to lower grip levels and less consistent racing surfaces. Finally, we anticipate that driver consistency will vary by track type but remain relatively stable within the same driver across races."

    "\n",
    "- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rockyt07/formula-1-championships-1950-2025  \n",
    "    - This data set from Kaggle Formula 1 Championships (1950-2025) contains historical data sets beginning from 1950 to prior year, that includes csv files that consist of data such as but not limited to results, standing, championship information. Other data consists of outcome, driver, teams, pit stops, points and performance metrics. The data is collected from 21 countries, totalling five continents. \n",
    "- https://tracinginsights.com/data/ \n",
    "    - Tracinginsights includes data from 1950 to the most recent race. Data includes items such as telemetry data, race results lap times, practice, qualifying, sprint race, grand prix race times, speed, brake application, gear selection, throttle input percentage, lateral acceleration or g-force, DRS activation zones, track elevation changes, vertical acceleration, engine rpm and longitudinal acceleration. This data set also includes fuel correction for the purpose of reducing weight, 1 kg per 0.03 seconds per lap, to take into account fuel weight, performance evaluation, comparison songs laps, and pace improvements. Stint analysis is provided to recognize tire degradation exclusively from fuel weight effects. Elevation chart is provided for data validity. For example, if elevation levels are significantly different among drivers, one can assume data is incorrect. It also provides information regarding peaks and valleys amongst drivers, error checking for horizontal shifts and unusual drops of spikes for sensor errors. \n",

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "This project relies exclusively on publicly available Formula 1 race data, including lap times, tyre compounds, and circuit characteristics released by Formula 1, the FIA, and reputable third-party motorsport databases. No direct interaction with drivers, teams, or other individuals occurs, and no private or proprietary data are collected. Because the data are historical, observational, and already in the public domain, informed consent from individuals is not applicable in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "We recognize that Formula 1 data collection may introduce biases related to race-specific events such as safety cars, red flags, weather changes, and retirements, which can disproportionately affect lap-time degradation measurements. Additionally, differences in track layouts and race lengths between street circuits and permanent circuits may lead to uneven representation across categories. To address these issues, we explicitly document data exclusions, normalize lap-time metrics where appropriate, and interpret results within the context of these known sources of bias rather than attributing outcomes solely to tyre compounds or driver performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "All our data comes from public databases\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "Our analysis focuses on quantitative performance metrics and does not capture qualitative factors such as driver feedback, team communications, or real-time strategic decision-making during races. These perspectives may influence tyre management and lap-time consistency but are not directly observable in the available data. To mitigate this limitation, we contextualize findings using existing Formula 1 regulations, race reports, and established motorsport knowledge, and we avoid making causal claims that would require access to these missing perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "The dataset may reflect imbalances in tyre compound usage, circuit types, and competitive conditions across the 2021–2025 regulation era. For example, certain tyre compounds may be used more frequently at specific circuits, and stronger teams may complete longer stints under favorable conditions. We address these biases by stratifying analyses by circuit type, controlling for stint length, and clearly stating assumptions and limitations where confounding variables cannot be fully removed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "All visualizations and summary statistics are designed to accurately reflect the underlying race data without exaggerating trends or masking variability. Axis scales, aggregation choices, and comparisons between tyre compounds and circuit types are selected to avoid misleading interpretations. Where variability is high or sample sizes differ across circuits or seasons, this uncertainty is clearly communicated rather than smoothed over.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "The analysis does not involve private or sensitive information. All data used consist of publicly available lap times, tyre choices, and circuit classifications that are widely reported in Formula 1 coverage. No attempts are made to infer personal characteristics or private behavior beyond what is explicitly observable in race performance data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "The full analytical process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, filtering criteria, and modeling choices, is documented to ensure reproducibility. This documentation allows results to be independently verified and enables future review if errors, biases, or alternative interpretations are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "We carefully select modeling metrics to align with the research question and avoid misleading optimization. Instead of relying on a single outcome measure, we analyze multiple complementary metrics, including lap-time degradation rates and measures of lap-time variability to capture driver consistency. This approach reduces the risk that conclusions are driven by artifacts of a single metric and allows for a more nuanced comparison across tyre compounds and circuit types.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "We clearly communicate the limitations of our modeling approach, including the observational nature of Formula 1 race data, the presence of unobserved confounding variables such as weather and strategic decisions, and simplifications involved in classifying circuits and tyre behavior. Model outputs are presented as descriptive or associative findings rather than causal claims, and conclusions are framed to avoid overgeneralization beyond the scope of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "Although this project is not deployed as a production system, we acknowledge the possibility that analytical results could be misinterpreted or taken out of context. For example, findings about lap-time degradation or driver consistency could be incorrectly attributed solely to driver skill rather than broader factors such as team resources, race strategy, or external conditions. To mitigate this risk, results are presented with clear explanations, appropriate caveats, and explicit statements about the observational and non-causal nature of the analysis.\n"
