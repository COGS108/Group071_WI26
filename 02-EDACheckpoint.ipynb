    "### OpenF1 RedBull drivers' stint tyre degredations & laptimes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: OpenF1 is a data set that includes 18 endpoints, often ranging from team radio to throttle traces. It includes data such as but not limited to, car telemetry, lap times, race positions, pit stops, team radio, weather, race control and championship standings. Data will be accessed via CSV format to API calls. As live data requires a paid account, we will not be considering live data from this set. The endpoints that we decided to use for our purposes are: sessions, drivers, and stints. The important variables that we will be using for our dataset is: compound, driver_number, lap_end, lap_start, meeting_key, session_key, stint_number, tyre_age_at_start, lap_end_duration, fastest_lap_duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The units for tyre_age_at_start is an integer in number of laps old. The units for lap_end_duration is seconds. The units for fastest_lap_duration is seconds. We are comparing the fastest lap time rather than the first lap of the stint as tyres need to warm up before they get to a working temperature where they are optimal and the lap times become a minimum. This could take a number of laps into the stint so we did not choose to take the first lap of the stint as the best possible lap time to compare for degredation. We chose to look at the lap time of the last lap of the stint as this would be the stint where the tyres are most worn and thus would lead to the greatest point of comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried to limit the variability of the dataset by limiting our dataset to one constructor team, RedBull racing, to ensure that there are no differences in the cars that would lead to differences in tyre degredation. One concern is that the dataset does not take into account the unique characteristics of each circuit which could lead to longer tyre lifetime or shorter lifetimes. Additionally, F1 is a very dynamic sport and there are many events occuring at the same time that lead to strategy changes during the race that could lead to the drivers opting to extend the stint to perform an \"overcut\" on their opponents, or pitting early to perform an \"undercut\" on their opponents. This is a variable that we simply cannot predict or take into account."
