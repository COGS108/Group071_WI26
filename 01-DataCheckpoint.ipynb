    "How does tyre degradation within individual stints, measured as the difference between the fastest lap and the final lap of that stint, differ between Red Bull Racing drivers across circuits during the 2023 to 2025 regulation era, and how is that degradation related to the tyre age at the end of the stint?"

    "Formula 1 is a technologically advanced motorsport in which race performance is shaped not only by final results, but also by underlying factors such as tyre behavior, car setup, and track characteristics. Modern Formula 1 cars operate at the intersection of mechanical engineering, aerodynamics, and data-driven decision making. Over recent decades, advancements in engineering and data collection have made it possible to analyze race performance at a much finer granularity, including lap-by-lap pace and stint-level trends. Prior work has shown that these factors play a critical role in shaping race dynamics, particularly through tyre degradation and consistency of lap times over a race distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering-focused analyses of Formula 1 emphasize how regulatory stability and technical innovation influence performance trends over time. For example, a historical review of Formula 1 engineering development highlights how improvements in materials, aerodynamics, and power units have steadily increased both performance and data availability in the sport (Evolution of Formula One Motorsport, Academia.edu). This work demonstrates that as engineering systems become more sophisticated, performance differences increasingly emerge through operational factors such as tyre management and race strategy rather than raw speed alone. This context motivates a closer examination of lap-level performance metrics, which can reveal meaningful patterns beyond race outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "More focused prior work has examined tyre compounds and degradation directly. The official Formula 1 tyre guide explains how different compounds are designed to trade off grip and durability, with softer tyres providing higher initial performance at the cost of faster degradation (Formula1.com, Beginner's Guide to F1 Tyres). Complementing this practical perspective, recent academic research has modeled tyre degradation using lap-time data, demonstrating that degradation can be quantified as a systematic increase in lap times over a stint rather than random noise (arXiv:2512.00640). These studies show that tyre degradation and lap-time variability are measurable, interpretable phenomena. However, much of this work focuses on individual races or modeling approaches, rather than descriptive, multi-season analysis. Our project builds on these insights by examining lap-time degradation and driver consistency across multiple seasons (2021-2025), tyre compounds, and track types using publicly available race data.\n",

    "We hypothesize that softer tyre compounds will show faster lap-time degradation than harder compounds across all tracks. We also expect that in lap-times will be shorter earlier in the stint when the tyres are fresher as compared to later in the stint when the tyres are older. We anticipate that the tyre degradation for both drivers of the Red Bull Racing team will be similar due to running the same car. Finally, we anticipate that driver consistency will vary by track type but remain relatively stable within the same driver across races."

    "### OpenF1 RedBull drivers' stint tyre degredations & laptimes \n",
    "\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "OpenF1 is a data set that includes 18 endpoints, often ranging from team radio to throttle traces. It includes data such as but not limited to, car telemetry, lap times, race positions, pit stops, team radio, weather, race control and championship standings. Data will be accessed via CSV format to API calls. As live data requires a paid account, we will not be considering live data from this set. The endpoints that we decided to use for our purposes are: sessions, drivers, and stints. The important variables that we will be using for our dataset is: compound, driver_number, lap_end, lap_start, meeting_key, session_key, stint_number, tyre_age_at_start, lap_end_duration, fastest_lap_duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The units for tyre_age_at_start is an integer in number of laps old. The units for lap_end_duration is seconds. The units for fastest_lap_duration is seconds. We are comparing the fastest lap time rather than the first lap of the stint as tyres need to warm up before they get to a working temperature where they are optimal and the lap times become a minimum. This could take a number of laps into the stint so we did not choose to take the first lap of the stint as the best possible lap time to compare for degredation. We chose to look at the lap time of the last lap of the stint as this would be the stint where the tyres are most worn and thus would lead to the greatest point of comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried to limit the variability of the dataset by limiting our dataset to one constructor team, RedBull racing, to ensure that there are no differences in the cars that would lead to differences in tyre degredation. One concern is that the dataset does not take into account the unique characteristics of each circuit which could lead to longer tyre lifetime or shorter lifetimes. Additionally, F1 is a very dynamic sport and there are many events occuring at the same time that lead to strategy changes during the race that could lead to the drivers opting to extend the stint to perform an \"overcut\" on their opponents, or pitting early to perform an \"undercut\" on their opponents. This is a variable that we simply cannot predict or take into account.\n",

    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\\\n",
    "<br>The dataset may reflect imbalances in tyre compound usage, circuit types, and competitive conditions across the 2021–2025 regulation era. For example, certain tyre compounds may be used more frequently at specific circuits, and stronger teams may complete longer stints under favorable conditions. We address these biases by stratifying analyses by circuit type, controlling for stint length, and clearly stating assumptions and limitations where confounding variables cannot be fully removed.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\\\n",
    "<br>All visualizations and summary statistics are designed to accurately reflect the underlying race data without exaggerating trends or masking variability. Axis scales, aggregation choices, and comparisons between tyre compounds and circuit types are selected to avoid misleading interpretations. Where variability is high or sample sizes differ across circuits or seasons, this uncertainty is clearly communicated rather than smoothed over.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\\\n",
    "<br>The analysis does not involve private or sensitive information. All data used consist of publicly available lap times, tyre choices, and circuit classifications that are widely reported in Formula 1 coverage. No attempts are made to infer personal characteristics or private behavior beyond what is explicitly observable in race performance data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\\\n",
    "<br>The full analytical process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, filtering criteria, and modeling choices, is documented to ensure reproducibility. This documentation allows results to be independently verified and enables future review if errors, biases, or alternative interpretations are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "- **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "- **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\\\n",
    "<br>We carefully select modeling metrics to align with the research question and avoid misleading optimization. Instead of relying on a single outcome measure, we analyze multiple complementary metrics, including lap-time degradation rates and measures of lap-time variability to capture driver consistency. This approach reduces the risk that conclusions are driven by artifacts of a single metric and allows for a more nuanced comparison across tyre compounds and circuit types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\\\n",
    "<br>We clearly communicate the limitations of our modeling approach, including the observational nature of Formula 1 race data, the presence of unobserved confounding variables such as weather and strategic decisions, and simplifications involved in classifying circuits and tyre behavior. Model outputs are presented as descriptive or associative findings rather than causal claims, and conclusions are framed to avoid overgeneralization beyond the scope of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    "- **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "- **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "- **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\\\n",
    "<br>Although this project is not deployed as a production system, we acknowledge the possibility that analytical results could be misinterpreted or taken out of context. For example, findings about lap-time degradation or driver consistency could be incorrectly attributed solely to driver skill rather than broader factors such as team resources, race strategy, or external conditions. To mitigate this risk, results are presented with clear explanations, appropriate caveats, and explicit statements about the observational and non-causal nature of the analysis.\n"
